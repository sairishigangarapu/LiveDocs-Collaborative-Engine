## 🚀 Project Overview

**LiveDocs** is a production-grade collaborative workspace engine engineered to handle real-time rich text editing, infinite document nesting, and role-based access control. 

Unlike standard CRUD applications, LiveDocs implements an **event-driven architecture** using Firebase Firestore listeners to synchronize state across multiple clients with sub-100ms latency, ensuring a seamless "multiplayer" editing experience similar to Notion or Google Docs.

# 🛠️ Engineering Deep Dive

## System Architecture

The system utilizes a **serverless architecture** to handle scaling and real-time connections. State changes are propagated via Firestore snapshots, while the UI relies on optimistic updates to ensure zero-latency interactivity.

## 🧩 Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Recursive Document Routing & Nesting

**The Problem:** Notion-style documents allow infinite nesting (A Page inside a Page inside a Page). Standard file-based routing cannot handle arbitrary depth.
**The Solution:**

* Implemented a **dynamic catch-all route strategy** (`/documents/[...documentId]`) in the Next.js App Router.
* Engineered a recursive component tree that fetches child references lazily, preventing "waterfall" loading states while maintaining the hierarchical structure.

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Latency & Optimistic UI

**The Problem:** Waiting for a server round-trip (RTT) for every keystroke makes the editor feel sluggish.
**The Solution:**

* **Optimistic Updates:** The UI updates the local state *immediately* upon user input, while the database write happens asynchronously in the background.
* **Debounced Writes:** High-frequency input is batched to prevent database rate-limiting while maintaining the illusion of instant sync.

### Challenge 3: Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**The Problem:** Managing permissions for "Private" vs "Public" workspaces while allowing guest access.
**The Solution:**

* Integrated **Custom Claims** within the Auth payload to define strict roles (`Owner`, `Editor`, `Viewer`).
* Implemented middleware barriers that verify document ownership at the edge before serving the page content, ensuring zero data leakage.

## 📚 The Stack: Why Each Technology?

| Technology | Purpose | Engineering Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Next.js 14 (App Router)** | Framework | leveraged Server Components (RSC) for initial document load performance and SEO. |
| **Firebase Firestore** | Database & Sync | Chosen for its native WebSocket-based `onSnapshot` listeners which handle the heavy lifting of real-time pub/sub. |
| **Clerk** | Authentication | Offloaded complex session management and MFA security to a dedicated identity provider. |
| **Tailwind + Shadcn/UI** | Design System | rigorous consistency and accessibility (a11y) standards out of the box. |
| **TypeScript** | Type Safety | Enforced strict typing for document models to prevent runtime errors during state synchronization. |
